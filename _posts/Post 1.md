## Welcome
Hello World! I am Harry Edwards. 
Quite simply, I'm someone who has taken an interest in programming in the last year. To the detriment of my friends, I have been posting incessently my progress onto discord with the regularity as the sun rising and with the same result - blinding them to my magificence. To save them hours of their lives reading the babies first coding-for-kids scrapbook, I decided to create a blog of any progress I have been making on my game, tied with coding and programming I find interesting as someone getting into it.

As such, knowing my background is important as a comparison point. Don't worry, it's simple - I'm unqualified, only learning programming on and off for a year. I work exclusively in GameMakerStudio 2, dabbling in Godot for a little while, all to test the boundaries of what I can do. For most of the time, it is very little, but that's the fanastic thing that I feel doesn't get talked about a lot by programmers - how satisfying it is. Coding scratches an itch where progress is visable and tangable, yet new programmers (Like myself!) don't see that side when starting - the path is long and stretches to the horizon, so starting the trek is daunting. I myself wouldn't of started if I didn't have several people in my life who did it for work, showing off what they can do. You, the reader, may not have touched code in your life and want to. The best piece of advice is always "Just Start". [See Alex Norris comics for more detail.](https://webcomicname.com/post/183722270609)
